## Application description

Implement a simple accordion (expand and collapse) behavior for the given layout.

Requirements:

- AllÂ titles should always be visible.
- The first item should be in the expanded state by default.
- When an item is in the expanded state, the collapse icon should be visible next to the title (rightmost corner).
- When an item is in the collapsed state, the expand icon should be visible next to the title (rightmost corner).
- Clicking on the expand icon should collapse any expanded item and expand the selected item.
- Clicking on the collapse icon should collapse the description of the item.
- If the "Multiple" checkbox is checked, it should be possible to expand more than one item.
- If "Multiple" is not checked, when a new item is expanded, the current item should collapse then the new item should expand.


All the markup for the question has been added. As a candidate, you have to complete the Javascript file to implement the above-stated features/functionality.
